# Knoknok
Knoknok is a simple desktop and mobile app to send notifications to those you care about.

## Setup
To use Knoknok you need a running [Knoknok Server](https://github.com/SorceressLyra/knoknokServer)

Server setup is elaborated upon in it's repository.

Once the server is running: 
1. Open Knoknok either via the app or the tray icon on desktop.
2. Navigate to the settings page
3. Enter the URL of your server

That's it! Of course It's recommended to set a username and custom message.


## Building
Knoknok is currently on the Flutter Stable channel unless necessary packages have issues.

Firebase Cloud Messaging is utilized for background messaging on mobile devices. 

> [Flutter App Dependencies](pubspec.yaml)


> [Follow this guide for firebase flutter setup](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup)

Due to this you need:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `google-services.json` | Firebase configuration for Android. Place in `android/app/` |
| `GoogleServices-Info.plist` | Firebase configuration for iOS. Place in `ios/Runner/` |
| `firebase.json` | generated by `flutterfire configure` and is placed in the project root|

Desktop build has no need for firebase and can build without these.

## Testing

| Platform | Tested |
|------|-------------|
| `Android` | ✅ Tested in AVD and on physical Pixel 7|
| `IOS` | ❌ Untested |
| `Windows` | ✅ Tested on Windows 11 24H2|
| `Linux` | ❌ Untested and requires deps |
| `MacOS` | ❌ Untested |

No automated tests are written at this time, but once GitHub Actions are implemented tests will be written and automated for all pull-requests.

`flutter_test` will be used for Unit and Widget testing.
